Dynamically Simple Model of Atmospheric Chemical Complexity

The Dynamically Simple Model for Atmospheric Chemical Complexity (DSMACC) is a tropospheric chemistry box model designed to help understand the composition of the troposphere in a flexiable and friendly manner. It is written to address a range of problems ranging from calculating the expected concentrations of atmospheric radicals to comparing chemistry schemes. 

The original code development was by Mat Evans (now at York) and Kathryn Emmerson at the University of Leeds. Subsquently developement / testing work has been undertaken by Barron Henderson (UF), Dylan Millet (UMN), Micheal Berkley(U. Edinburgh),and Daniel Stone (U. Leeds). The interface for GEOS-Chem was developed by Jingqiu Mao (Harvard) and Mat Evans. 

The model code is available from here. It is based on the KPP chemistry integration code written at Virginia Tech by Adrian Sandu's group.
