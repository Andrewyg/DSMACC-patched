# Driving DSMACC with Python

After building a DSMACC model, you can drive it with python. This is great 
for rapid modification and easy editing.

Type `make` to:
- build a copy of cri/cri.kpp
- then compile a python library version of cri
- run driver.py to create a time series simulation based on a chamber study


driver.py is a simple example that could be copied and modified to make
alternate versions of the model.
