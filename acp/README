# ACP 

## Prerequisites:
 - installed KPP (../kpp/bin/kpp)

## Inventory

This folder contains the following files
 - acp.kpp: a file the contains kpp syntax to build a dsmacc model using VOC/NOx from pg 240 from Seinfeld and Pandis (ISBN: 978-0-471-72018-8)
 - acp_init.dat: initial conditions for a RH=200 and NOx=10 simulation
 - Makefile: a file with instructions on how to build and run the model.

## Instructions

To build and run the model, type "make" in a linux terminal
  $ make

The makefile will build the model (acp) and run it with initial
conditions from acp_init.dat. This will produce four outputs:
 - acp_conc_1.dat: concentrations in ! delimited format
 - acp_rate_1.dat: reaction rates in ! delimited format
 - acp.log: output log for warnings and/or errors
 - acp_conc_1.dat_O3.png: time series of ozone

## Switching Photolysis Options

Photolysis is not used, but set to a constant 0.015/s as in table notes.
