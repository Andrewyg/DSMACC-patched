# CRI with TUV Photolysis

## Prerequisites:
 - installed KPP (../kpp/bin/kpp)

## Inventory

This folder contains the following files
 - cri.kpp: a file the contains kpp syntax to build a dsmacc model with CRI
 - CRI_subset.kpp: the CRI subset from http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/CRI/.
 - cri_init.dat: initial conditions for a simple CRI simulation
 - Makefile: a file with instructions on how to build and run the model.

## Instructions

To build and run the model, type "make" in a linux terminal
  $ make

The makefile will build the model (cri) and run it with initial
conditions from cri_init.dat. This will produce four outputs:
 - cri_conc_1.dat: concentrations in ! delimited format
 - cri_rate_1.dat: reaction rates in ! delimited format
 - cri.log: output log for warnings and/or errors
 - cri_conc_1.dat_O3.png: time series of ozone

## Switching Photolysis Options

To use another photolysis model (MCM standard or FAST-JX), comment
out the `#INCLUDE tuv.inc` and uncomment out the other photolysis
option.

## Switching CRI_subset.kpp

To make a new CRI_subset.kpp:

1. go to http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/CRI/
2. select the base VOCs by selecting the check boxes associated with each species.
3. Once all the VOC's have been selected click 'Added Selection to Marked List.'
4. Then click on 'Extract' from the menu at the top of the page. 
  - Select "KPP, experimental KPP format".
  - Select "Include generic rate coefficients"
  - Select "Include inorganic reactions." 
  - Then, Click on Extract.
5. Copy the CRI_extract.kpp file over the version in this directory
6. Cleanup the download (see below).

The raw downloaded file has several problems:

 - radical comments have a } ending each line, but only have { on the first.
 - the line endings include both linux and windows.
 - reactions without produces should have a dummy species.
 - the dummy species name is missing.

Copying and pasting the command below will everything except the radical 
comments. Make sure that either each radical comment line begins with { and
ends with }, or that only the last radical comment line ends with }


python -c "txt = open('CRI_subset.kpp', 'rU').read(); # implicit line ending fix
txt = txt.replace('CALL mcm_constants', '! CALL mcm_constants'); # comment out mcm_constants
txt = txt.replace('= :', '= DUMMY :'); # add DUMMY to productless reactions
txt = txt.replace('\n = IGNORE', 'DUMMY = IGNORE') # fix DUMMY species definition
open('CRI_subset.kpp', 'w').write(txt);"
