# CRI with TUV Photolysis

This folder contains the following files
 - cri.kpp: a file the contains kpp syntax to build a dsmacc model with CRI
 - CRI_subset.kpp: the CRI subset from http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/CRI/. File 
                   requires cleanup after download
 - cri_init.dat: initial conditions for a simple CRI simulation
 - Makefile: a file with instructions on how to build and run the model.

To build and run the model, type "make" in a linux terminal
  $ make

The makefile will build the model (cri) and run it with initial
conditions from cri_init.dat. This will produce three outputs:
 - cri_conc_1.dat
 - cri_rate_1.dat
 - cri.log

To use another photolysis model (MCM standard or FAST-JX), comment
out the `#INCLUDE tuv.inc` and uncomment out the other photolysis
option.
